# action-setup-node
This action wraps the [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) action and implements [Aikido Safe-Chain](https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain) to fail install upon an attempt to install a malicious node package. Please refer to the [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) documentation as this action is a like-for-like replacement, however, in all instances please use `linz/setup-node` rather than `actions/setup-node`.
